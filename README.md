## Challange
In order to know how much money I will have whilst on my holiday, I need you to write an application that calls the two provided APIs to calculate what the exchange rate is along with which countries I will be able to spend my money in.

**APIs**
- [Exchange Rate](http://data.fixer.io/api/latest?access_key=f68b13604ac8e570a00f7d8fe7f25e1b&format=1)
- [Countires](http://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/currency/GBP)

## Initilaization
I have provided a small node.js application as a starting platform for the challange, however, if you want to use a different language please feel free.

Remember to run `$ npm install` before trying to run the program.
